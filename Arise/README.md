## LDmod4 but it's expanded by someone who's not an actual coder
- (LDmod4-Rai-online.swf; LDmod4-Rai-offline.swf)
This project is the byproduct of a split second idea for the Snow MDC. The level, Arise, is not an entry anymore, but I still intend in seeing it through.

To load this file in your level, open its code in a text editor (Notepad, Notepad++) and paste one of the following strings at the very end, after your level name.

Online version: `%3Cimg%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRaiyuuni%2Flevel_assets%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2FArise%2FLDmod4-Rai-online.swf%22%3E`

Offline version: `%3Cimg%20src%3D%22%2E%5C63ModDirectory%5CLDmod4%2DRai%2Doffline%2Eswf%22%3E`

It is important that you do name your level. It (likely) won't load if it doesn't have a name.
